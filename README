AutoOverride is a simple FML coremod that makes it easy to override Vanilla
Minecraft classes entirely.

This can and will happily break other coremods or direct minecraft.jar
modifications, so beware conflicts with things like Optifine.


Usage:

This is a mod directory designed for use with mcp_deobfuscate and its
mcp_interface.  It can be used without, but mcp_interface is recommended.

See https://github.com/FunnyMan3595/mcp_deobfuscate/blob/master/README
and https://github.com/FunnyMan3595/mcp_deobfuscate/blob/mcp_interface/README.txt
for more details.


To use WITH mcp_interface:
* Install this directory in $MCP/mods/
* Edit ./conf/PROJECT_NAME to contain your mod's name.
  (You may want to add conf/VERSION as well, so that your coremod doesn't
   default to version "alpha".)
* Place the modified Minecraft source file(s) in src/common/net/minecraft/src/.
* Rename ./src/common/YOURMOD/ to match conf/PROJECT_NAME.
  (I may fix this later, because it's an extra step that annoys me.)
* Run recompile_mods, fix any errors, and repeat until there are none.
* Your completed coremod will now be in $MCP/packages/.


To use WITHOUT mcp_interface:
* Copy ./src/common/YOURMOD to $MCP/src/common/$YOURMOD, renaming appropriately.
  (You are using Forge at least, right?  RIGHT?)
* Edit $MCP/src/common/$YOURMOD/AutoOverride.java, and replace each:
  %conf:PROJECT_NAME%
  with $YOURMOD (the actual name, that is).
* Edit ./resources/common/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and replace likewise.
* Run recompile and reobfuscate.
* Create a zipfile contaiing:
  META-INF/MANIFEST.MF                  (from ./resources/common/)
  $YOURMOD/*                            (from $MCP/reobf/minecraft/)
  Any class files you want to overwrite (from $MCP/reobf/minecraft/)
* Rename the zipfile to have a .jar extension.
  (And don't complain to me.  I tried: https://github.com/cpw/FML/pull/124)
* You now have a coremod.
